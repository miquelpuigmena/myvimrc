# Myvimrc
## Description
This repo has my vim configuration to be used when programming. The vimrc
doesn't have a target programming language. 

For programming language specifics, see the [mysnippets](./mysnippets) folder. 
This folder contains a list of files, where each file makes reference to a 
programming language. A snippet includes utilities that will make life easier 
when writing code.
